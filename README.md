## Android_Flashcard_APP

### App Description
`TODO://` This is Android flashcard app that I developed using Android Studio, Java programming, and XML markup. This app displays a
a screen on the Android emulator and on an Android mobile device. The app displays a question in which the user can click on the
question for the answer to appear.

### App Walk-though
`TODO://`I designed the app's background within Android Studio by referencing an image's address. I modified the question text and text
color of my choice for display purposes. Using an onClickListener(), I programmed the app to no longer be a static screen, but to
generate the answer to the question to appear once the question has been clicked. To do this, I made the question visible until
clicked and once the question has been clicked, the question would become invisible and the answer would become visible.
